## Projects
### [Dynamic-ECG](opensource.md#dynamic-ecg/Dynamic-ECG): Algorithms for ECG Signal Analysis 
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GitHub-181717?style=flat&logo=github)](https://github.com/Heartbeatman/dynamic_ecg)   ![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NumPy-013243?style=flat&logo=numpy&logoColor=white)![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white)

My Python-based library for ECG analysis, including R,P,T wave detection, Poincare analysis, wavelets based analysis and several Visualisation features! Portability with both short ECG & Long Form Holter data. Formats such as NumPy, EDF, H5 and even Apple Watch ECG data (CSV export).





### [CatchAF](opensource.md#CatchAF/CatchAF): Multi-Modal Atrial Fibrillation Detection Model

An AF detection model that uses Dynamic-ECG for Poincare-Plot generation as the data input for a Computer Vision model. Trained on the [IRIDIA-AF](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02621-1) dataset, the model achieved a 98% accuracy in detecting AF from ECG data. The model is available for download and use in the CatchAF repository.


### Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cardiac CT-Fluoroscopy Registration

Implemented a deep reinforcement learning model using PyTorch and deep Q network to register 6DOF cardiac CT images with fluoroscopy images. Achieved a 90% success rate in image registration, improving the accuracy of cardiac procedures. Collaborated with CHU de Bordeaux, France, and the UWA Medical Imaging Physics Group, using CARTO EP files.
