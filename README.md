### Real-time Arrhythmia AI Detection System - 10/2023
**Lead Engineer | CloudHolter**

- Developed a Non-Linear Dynamical model to detect arrhythmias in ECG signals, achieving 97% accuracy in detecting 10 different arrhythmias, using a custom Computer Vision CNN model, implemented with TensorFlow, model served onto Sagemaker.
- Designed beat detection & extraction using a custom-designed algorithm, benchmarked against the MIT-BIH database, implemented with Python into an AWS lambda.
- Implemented full inference pipeline using AWS Sagemaker, lambda, and API Gateway, achieving real-time user ML inference.
- Constructed s3 dataset for training and validation, with a custom data pipeline for data augmentation and labeling, using AWS Sagemaker and Textract of EMRs.

### Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cardiac CT-Fluoroscopy Registration - 11/2023
**UWA, Engineering Masters Thesis & [Liryc, de Bordeaux, France](https://www.ihu-liryc.fr/en/)**

- Developed a deep reinforcement learning model using PyTorch to register 6DOF cardiac CT images with fluoroscopy images.
- Registration of 3D CT images with 2D fluoroscopy images, using a custom-designed algorithm, implemented with Python and PyTorch.
- Acquired 90% success rate in registering images, improving the accuracy of cardiac procedures.
- Collaborated with CHU de Bordeaux, France, and the UWA Medical Imaging Physics Group, using CARTO EP files.
